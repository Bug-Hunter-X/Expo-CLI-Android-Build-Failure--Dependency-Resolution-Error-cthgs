This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android APK.  The error message is usually vague, stating something like "Could not resolve all files for configuration ':app:debugImplementation'". This is often due to a mismatch between the versions of dependencies specified in your project's `package.json` and those actually available in the Android build system,  or missing Android SDK components.  Sometimes this occurs when Gradle sync fails.
