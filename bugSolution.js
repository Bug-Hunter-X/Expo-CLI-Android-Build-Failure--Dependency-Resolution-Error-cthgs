The solution involves multiple steps:

1. **Clean the project:**  Delete the `android` folder in your project.
2. **Check `package.json`:** Ensure that all your dependencies are compatible with the latest Expo SDK version. Resolving any dependency conflicts is important.
3. **Verify Android SDK:** In Android Studio, check if all the necessary Android SDK components and build tools are properly installed. Use the SDK Manager to install missing packages.
4. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:**  Invalidate caches and restart Android Studio.
5. **Gradle Sync:** Ensure a successful Gradle sync in Android Studio before attempting to build the project.
6. **Check for Specific Error Messages:** Look carefully in the logs for more specific error messages, which sometimes pinpoint the exact dependency conflict.
7. **Downgrade (if Necessary):**  As a last resort, if conflicts persist, try downgrading certain dependencies to versions explicitly known to work with your Expo SDK version. This is generally a less desirable solution. 

Example of a more informative error message to look for in Gradle build logs:

```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
...
Could not find artifact com.example:somelibrary:1.0.0
...
```
This identifies a missing or inaccessible dependency `com.example:somelibrary:1.0.0`.
